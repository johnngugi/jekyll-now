CSS is a type of language used to style webpages.
CSS styles t allows us to add layout and design to our pages, and it allows us to share those styles from element to element and page to page.

## Selectors

CSS uses selectors to apply styles to the HTML elements in a web page. For example p {} selects all the paragraph elements within the HTML document and applies the styles to it. There are three types of selectors:
  elements selectors
  class selectors
  id selectors.
For example: class selectors use a period infront of the class name. .logo {} selects all the logo classes.
id selectors use a # infront of the id name. For example #logo {} selects all the logo classes.  

## Properties

CSS uses properties within selectors to determine which styles to apply to the HTML elements. For example : p {
  background: green;
}
In this example the background property applies a background to all paragraph elements.

## Values

The properties accept values specific to the properties. For example: p {
  color: red;
}
In this example the color property has a value of green.

## The Cascade

Within CSS, all styles cascade from the top of a style sheet to the bottom, allowing different styles to be added or overwritten as the style sheet progresses. This allows different styles to be applied and overwritten.
