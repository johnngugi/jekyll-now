# HTML

## HTML basics for Beginners

HTML is a type of language used to make webpages. HTML gives content structure and meaning by defining the content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.

### Elements

Elements are designators that define the contents and structure of a webpage, for example headings, paragraphs, images, links. Elements are surrounded by less than < and greater than > angle brackets. For example ```<h1>``` is identified as a heading.

### Tags

The use of greater than and less than angle brackets create what is known as a tag.
Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags. A closing tag has a backslash after the opening angle bracket. For example <h1> ... </h1>. Most elements recquire an open and closing tag, however some just require an opening tag.

### Attributes

Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.
For example <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, the href attribute provides a link to google.com

### HTML document structure

All HTML documents require the following tags:
<DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<body>
