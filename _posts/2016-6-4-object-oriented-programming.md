Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to
design and build applications. 

Objects:
Objects have states and behaviors. An object is a self-contained component that contains properties
and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful. An objectâ€™s properties are what it knows
and its methods are what it can do.

Classes and instances:
A class can be defined as a blue print that describes the behaviors and states that object of its type
support.  Every object is built from a class. Each class should be designed and programmed to
accomplish one, and only one, thing. Because each class is designed to have only a single
responsibility, many classes are used to build an entire application. An instance is a specific object
built from a specific class. It is assigned to a reference variable that is used to access all of the
instance's properties and methods. When you make a new instance the process is called
instantiation.
So, a class is like a blue print for a house. You can use the same blue print to build many houses.
Instantiation is following what is on the blueprint. You can instantiate as many instances of a class as you want.
